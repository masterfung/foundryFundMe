# Foundry Fund Me

Getting familiar with the foundry ecosystem and trying it out on the FundMe Contract, leveraging
the Chainlink services. 

The repo uses Etherscan, Sepolia's RPC URL, and private key. Please take a look at the `.env.example` 
to obtainn the required keys. You can obtain Etherscan from their site. I used Alchemy for Sepolia but
you can use any free service out there. 

Please reference the `Makefile` for common commands and shortcuts.
